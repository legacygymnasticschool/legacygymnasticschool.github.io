                    The Rhythmic XCEL program allows kids to have positive competitive 
                    experiences in an official USA Gymnastics setting with less commitment 
                    and training time required. The program also allows athletes to 
                    participate in Rhythmic Gymnastics while staying active in school and 
                    family activities. The rules for Rhythmic Xcel are designed to put the 
                    focus on personal progress rather than competitive placement. Therefore, 
                    athletes can be challenged and happy in a single level for multiple 
                    years. The gymnasts competing in XCEL will not be ranked by score, they 
                    only compete against themselves. The XCEL competition season is shorter 
                    than a regular competition season and gymnasts are only required to 
                    commit to half of the year, and may choose to take the other half of the year off.

                    The Rhythmic Junior Olympic Program is a developmental program that

                    the time they are ready to make the move to the Elite Program (FIG). 
                    Our Junior Olympic (Levels 3-8) and FIG (Levels 9 & 10) team programs 
                    are governed by the USA Gymnastics organization and are developed and 
                    judged based on the International Code of Points. These intense, 
                    competitive programs are preparing gymnasts for state, regional, 
                    national and international championships and competitions. The gymnasts 
                    begin training in July, which includes required attendance to learn 
                    choreographed routines in preparation for competitions that begin in 
                    December and continue through the following June.

                    Private lessons are strongly encouraged for gymnasts at the higher levels

                    gymnasts a competitive edge and act as a catalyst for performance 
                    breakthroughs. We also offer private lessons for dancers, cheerleaders, 
                    and ice skaters who want to increase their flexibility and strength to 
                    improve their performance. Private lessons are scheduled directly 
                    through the owner.
